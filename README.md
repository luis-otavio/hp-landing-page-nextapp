## Introduction

Harry Potter Landing Page is a streamlined web application built with React and Next.js, showcasing an engaging exploration of the Harry Potter universe. Designed for a application test, it highlights my ability to create responsive, dynamic web applications. Features include live search, dynamic sorting, and responsive pagination, all powered by a public Harry Potter API.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Technologies Used

<p>To construct this immersive web application and deliver an exceptional user experience, our selection of technologies reflects a commitment to modern development standards and performance efficiency:</p>

- **Next.js**: Selected for its unparalleled support for server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), Next.js forms the foundation of our application. It ensures quick load times and a seamless, secure browsing experience, essential for interactive web applications.<br />

- **SCSS**: For styling, we opted for SCSS, an extension of CSS that enables us to use variables, nested rules, mixins, and more. This choice allows for a more organized, maintainable, and scalable styling approach, facilitating the creation of a responsive and visually appealing interface.<br />

- **TypeScript**: Adopted to enhance code quality and maintainability, TypeScript provides static typing capabilities. This not only helps in catching errors early in the development process but also improves the overall development experience with better tooling support, leading to a more robust and error-free application.<br />

<p>Each technology in our stack was carefully chosen to ensure the development of a cutting-edge, user-centric web application. By leveraging the strengths of Next.js, SCSS, and TypeScript, we've created an app that's not only fast and responsive but also scalable and easy to maintain, promising an engaging user experience for all Harry Potter fans.</p>

## Features

**Character Exploration**: Delve into the detailed world of Harry Potter characters. Our app allows users to explore characters, showcasing details like name, house, date of birth, patronus, and alive status. This comprehensive overview is enhanced by vivid images, ensuring an immersive experience.<br />

**Dynamic Search Functionality**: Find your favorite characters with ease. The application features a real-time search functionality that updates the displayed characters as you type, ensuring you quickly locate the character you're interested in without navigating through multiple pages.<br />

**Sorting Capability**: Organize character listings to your preference. With options to sort by name, date of birth, or life status (alive or deceased) in both ascending and descending orders, users can easily navigate through the vast array of characters, finding their desired profiles with simplicity.<br />

**Responsive and Adaptive Design**: Built using SCSS, the app's layout is fully responsive, providing a seamless and engaging user experience across various devices and screen sizes. This responsiveness ensures that users can explore the wizarding world on their preferred devices without compromise.<br />

**Server-Side Rendering with Next.js**: Leverage the power of Next.js for faster page loads and improved SEO. Server-side rendering ensures that the character data is preloaded, offering a snappy experience right from the first visit.<br />

**Type-Safe Development with TypeScript**: To ensure reliability and maintainability, the app is developed using TypeScript. This adds an additional layer of safety by catching errors and bugs during development, leading to a more robust and error-free application.<br />

**Paginated Character Display**: Given the extensive list of characters, our app employs a pagination system, adapting the number of characters displayed per page based on the screen size. This approach ensures a tidy and accessible interface, preventing information overload and enhancing user navigation.<br />

These features collectively offer a rich and engaging platform for Harry Potter fans to explore their favorite characters in-depth. By leveraging modern web technologies such as React, Next.js, SCSS, and TypeScript, the HP-Landing-Page stands as a testament to what can be achieved with the right tools and a passion for creating enchanting user experiences.
